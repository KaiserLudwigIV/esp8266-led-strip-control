# Led strip control with website

## Setup

To have this sketch working in your network simply change the **ssid** and the **pwd** to your local network and change the **mdnsName**
to your favorite **(wifi.cpp)**. To define the amount of led pixel and the data pin of your esp8266, change the values **NUM_LEDS** and
**FASTLED_DATA_PIN** **(LedModi.cpp)**. Upload the code to your microcontroller, connect your pins and start playing the modes.
